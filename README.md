# SMTPMailServer
Just a simple Java Program to send Direct Mails. By this time, Google has already blocked me from sending mails to their servers :) 
Of course they did it to prevent spams but I just wanted to learn few things and I did before it happened. Great!

But yes you always have alternatives like mailtrap, mailspons etc to do the same without getting blocked because they are all about testing smtp and so on.
But if you just wanna go on and continue learning with gmail, you may want to get your ip removed from Spamhaus DB which may well work for a while.
